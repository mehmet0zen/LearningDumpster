# App Development
### About my journey with application development, I tried lots of different ways to make it fun, but if it's not some interesting project, I cannot focus on coding for it.
At this point, the most fun-to-use program was Swift for me!

### App Dev Projects:
For this repo, I have my Swift projects and a simple C++ project (That runs in terminal) I made back in 2019 to create a custom Minecraft server.

**Swift Projects:**
Most of these swift projects are coming from an online tutorial I took from Udemy [iOS & Swift Bootcamp - by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/).
