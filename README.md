# LearningDumpster
These projects are the things I did during my 3-4 years of the learning process.

Most of them were made with macOS, and none of them are guaranteed to work on other Operating Systems!

addition to MIT - License, anyone can download and use the codes in this repro, 
but I don't suggest using it for a commercial purpose, most of these projects 
are made from tutorials and courses that I get to learn in my way of becoming a developer, 
but using it to learn or using part of it to improve your code is totally fine (if you understand the code)!
