# Web Development
### I took "Web Development 101" class only, but for the rest, I tried learning more and more about CSS and JS.

---

## The projects I made:
1. Coding Class Website
    - I originally teach 1-5th graders coding lessons, and with the school limitations, they weren't able to save their work, I created a website where they will open a digital bag of their own and submit their works to install and use later again, just like git.
2. Personal Site
    - Like everyone, I was also looking for some jobs on the internet, and I needed a website to showcase my works! Currently, this is the online version -> [Personal Site](https://kosmotion.indie.af/) it's been a while since I haven't updated it.
