# Game Development
### I mostly used Unity Game Engine for development, I took online courses and tried watching lots of tutorials about it! For the last couple of months, I'm trying different game engines to see if I can improve my programming knowledge on those.

Visit my [itch page](https://kosmotion.itch.io) to play the games I published.

## The Game Engines I used:

1. **Unity**:
   - Unity is a powerful and fun-to-use game engine, it has lots of useful tools that help you to build up your game! 
   - At first, I loved unity but later on, I decided to try others.
2. **GDevelop**:
   - After Unity, I gave it a try to GDevelop.
   - GDevelop is a visual scripting game engine, you don't even need to worry about any bugs or smash your head into the wall just to try solving what's wrong in your code. I was against non-code game engines but the GDevelop community made it fun to use Visual Scripting!
3. **Godot**:
   - Godot has a few developers right now because it's an open-source game engine! However, Godot is so fun to use and there are lots of great things about it!
   - Godot has its own programming language called GD-Script but you can also use C# or C++ (Even Visual Scripting.) to create a game with it.
   - Godot has both 2D and 3D support.
   - I couldn't upload any project that I made, because there is no fully working project that I can show right now with Godot.
4. **Processing**:
   - I didn't do much with processing but it was fun to try it out, using only start, and draw methods it made it very simple to render objects on the screen!
5. **Pygame**:
   - Pygame is not a game engine, but a framework, instead of installing an application, you have to import a library to use its functionality.
   - Pygame was the point where I get to improve my python skills!

### Other Engines/Frameworks I tried learning:
- Unreal
- Cocos2D
- Defold
- Py-glet
- GameMaker2
- LÃ–VE
- MonoGame
